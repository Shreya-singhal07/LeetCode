# LeetCode
Hii everyone,
I've been watching lot of tutorials online for DSA but I realised in the long run, I don't actually remember the concepts. It's really hard 
when I started to pracise questions and I'm still in that phase but I could actually feel progress and improvement in my logic and code. Each question 
teaches me something new and the small conceptual mistakes that we overlook. I started doing questions on leetcode and I'll try to consistent with it.
I'm just uploading my solutions here to keep a track of them. Also, you can refer to my solutions (they aren't the most optimised one) anytime. 

keep practising!
